# 3DCNNs_TF2Modelhub

Almost all the deeplearning libraries provide ready to use 2D models with/without imagenet weights, But In case of 3D cnn models are not as avaible. This repo will contain commonly used 2D CNNs 3D implementations.


# Libraries:
1. Python 3.x 
2. Tensorflow 2.X
3. Numpy
4. random
