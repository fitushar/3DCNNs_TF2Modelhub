# 3DCNNs_TF2Modelhub

Almost all the deeplearning libraries provide ready to use 2D models with/without imagenet weights, But In case of 3D cnn models are not as avaible. This repo will contain commonly used 2D CNNs 3D implementations.


# Libraries Needed:
* Python 3.x 
* Tensorflow 2.X
* Numpy
* random
